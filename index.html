            </p>
            <p>
                New Year is celebrated all over the world with great enthusiasm and fun. Earlier, it was a Roman
                calendar which was having only ten months and designated 1st march as the new year. In the Gregorian
                calendar, there are 12 months in every year and the new year falls on January 1st which is widely
                accepted and celebrated the festival.

            <p>
                It is a special day for the people as this day is the beginning of the new year and they welcome the
                upcoming year in their way. People start the preparations for the new year celebration many days
                earlier. People buy new clothes, gifts and many new things from the market. Shops are full of the crowd
                these days. On the midnight of 31st December and on 1st January there is a celebration of New Year in
                India and all over the world.After the Christmas celebration people wait for the 31st night, that is the
                day when we recall all the good and bad memories of the whole year and say goodbye to the going year and
                welcoming the new year. People celebrate this day with music and dance. Children are very happy about
                this as they get lots of gifts and good food to enjoy the new year party.

            <p>
                The new year tree is made, it is a unique thing for children and adults, which is the object that can be
                seen in every house during the holiday. The whole family takes participation in decorating a tree, with
                toys, candles, and different New Year Lights. Children consider a tree to be mysteries because the
                Russian Santa Clause hides the presents under this tree.

                I love this eve. Many days before there is a preparation of cakes for the new year, at the parties,
                there is a new year cake cutting ceremony at midnight â€” this way people enjoy the parties and celebrate
                the new year festival.

                Year</p>
            <p>
                The earliest known new year celebrations were in Mesopotamia and date back to 2000 B.C.
                The Gregorian calendar, which marks January 1st as the new year, is adopted by the Roman Catholic
                Church.
                Chinese new year is celebrated the second full moon after the winter solstice.
                Jewish new year is called Rosh Hashanah. Apples and Honey are traditionally eaten.
                In ancient Rome the new year began on March 1st.
